MISULTIN - An Erlang library for building fast lightweight HTTP servers.
<https://github.com/ostinelli/misultin>

>-|-|-(°>


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================================================

1. Compile

Run the appropriate script:

    * OSX | Linux users:  make
    * Windows users: make.bat. Note that Erlang bin directory (by default, C:\Program Files\erl5.7.2\bin\)
      must be in your path for the script to work.

This script will compile the .erl files in the Misultin src directory and save the compiled files into the
ebin directory.

2. (Optional) Copy Misultin files

This optional step will allow Misultin to be called from modules running from any directory on your file
system.

Locate the directory where Erlang is installed on your system. Under OSX and Linux, it should be something
similar to /usr/local/lib/erlang/ or /usr/lib/erlang/. Under Windows, Erlang is installed by default in
something similar to C:\Program Files\erl5.7.2\ (version changes may apply).

Browse into the lib directory under this Erlang root and copy the root misultin-0.x directory into this
directory. You should now have Misultin under something similar to:

    * OSX | Linux users: /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/misultin-0.x/
    * Windows users: C:\Program Files\erl5.7.2\lib\misultin-0.x\ 

3. Test

If you did proceed with step 2, CD to the Misultin examples directory and start an Erlang shell.

If you did not proceed with step 2, copy the file misultin_hello_world.erl from the Misultin examples
directory to the directory where the .beam files compiled in step 1 are located, then CD to this
directory and start an Erlang shell.

In the shell, compile and run misultin_hello_world by issuing:

(one@rob.loc)1>c(misultin_hello_world).
{ok,misultin_hello_world}
(one@rob.loc)2>misultin_hello_world:start(8080).
{ok,<0.50.0>}

Open your favourite browser and point it to http://localhost:8080/, you should read "Hello World."
printed on your page.

You may now stop the misultin_hello_world HTTP server:

(one@rob.loc)3>misultin_hello_world:stop().

4. Congratulations!

You're ready to go.

CHANGELOG
==========================================================================================================
0.8-dev:
       - Misultin has been redesigned to use supervisor behaviours where appropriate, to be more OTP
         compliant
       - added Cookie support
       - added preliminary support multipart/form-data and a file upload example [thanks to Max Lapshin]
       - added Date and Server headers
       - added {binary, true} option so that data is treated as binary instead of list, this is mainly to
         reduce memory usage on applications which handle many concurrent open connections [following
         many discussions, but also thanks to cstar]
       - added support for headers being specified as binaries [thanks to akaspin]
       - added an example on how to properly embed misultin in your application
       - Req:get(peer_addr) now properly extracts peer information from headers "X-Real-Ip" or
         "X-Forwarded-For" if these are available [thanks to Max Lapshin]
       - solved bug on large data being sent over via websockets [thanks to omarkj]
       - corrected binary sending bug in websockets which would fail binaries on io_lib format [thanks to
         normanb]

0.7.1: - considerably improved stability under heavy load
       - misultin now accepts incoming connections with a pool of acceptors instead of a single one
       - Misultin can now be used both with parametrized modules and with pure erlang code too [thanks to
         yrashk, nox and essen]
       - added support for HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT methods
       - now websockets are on {active, once} mode to avoid malicious clients overflooding [thanks to
         essen]
       - ensured that body of request can be read on all methods except TRACE as per http specs
       - added support for iolist() in chunked resposes [thanks to RJ]

0.7:   - added max_connections options parameter, which specifies maximum concurrent open connections
         accepted by the server
       - added post_max_size options parameter, which sets the maximum size of POST data
       - added get_url_max_size options parameter, which sets the maximum length of URI
       - added CHUNKED support, both for incoming requests and outgoing responses [thanks to yrashk
         suggestion]
       - added trapping of client closing a browser in Comet applications [thanks to yrashk]
       - added SSL support for websockets [enhancement track #25, thanks to viplifes]
       - Misultin can now be started without a registered name or with a different name, so that multiple
         versions of misultin can be started on a single node
       - added support for IP address specified in tuple format [thanks to okeuday suggestion]
       - added support to extract plain uri unquoted as a list() [thanks to okeuday]
       - added Comet Long Polling example
       - added Comet iFrame example
       - added the killing of alive processes on server shutdown
       - the GET uri parameters are now also available on POST requests
